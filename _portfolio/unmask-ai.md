**Unmask AI** is a live bias-detection lab for large language models (LLMs), designed and developed during an international hackathon.  
The system empowers users to submit prompts, detect and analyze bias, cross-examine AI responses, reframe outputs from multiple perspectives, and override with human reasoning—all in a single interactive session.

### Key Features
- **Bias Detection:** Analyze LLM outputs for subtle and explicit bias.  
- **Cross-Examination:** Probe responses with guided follow-ups to expose inconsistencies.  
- **Perspective Reframing:** Generate outputs from alternative cultural and ideological viewpoints.  
- **Human Override:** Allow users to collaborate with AI by injecting reasoning and corrections.  
- **Reporting:** Export detailed session insights as structured PDF reports.  

**Tools/Stack:** FastAPI · PostgreSQL · OpenAI GPT-4o · SQLAlchemy · Streamlit · Jinja2 · WeasyPrint · Railway · Docker
