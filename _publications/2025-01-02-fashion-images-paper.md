Developed a multimodal AI pipeline that combines object detection with large language models to generate rich, culturally relevant captions and trend-aware hashtags for fashion imagery. Trained on a custom dataset of 2,500+ annotated images, the system achieved high object detection accuracy (F1 = 0.86) and demonstrated a 23% increase in engagement compared to generic hashtag strategies. Designed for applications in social media, digital marketing, and fashion e-commerce.
