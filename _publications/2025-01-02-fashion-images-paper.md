From Pixels to Posts proposes a retrieval-augmented framework for fashion image captioning and hashtag generation that improves attribute grounding and reduces hallucination. The system combines multi-garment detection with localized color extraction and CLIP-based retrieval to assemble structured visual evidence, which is then used to guide an LLM in generating visually faithful, stylistically rich captions and hashtags. Evaluated on a new South Asian fashion dataset, the approach shows stronger factual alignment and generalization than supervised captioning baselines, highlighting retrieval-augmented generation as a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world fashion content creation.
