Explored whether lightweight forecasting models like Facebook Prophet and NeuralProphet can rival deep learning approaches (LSTM, LightGBM) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> prediction using real-world air quality data from Beijing. Achieved RÂ² > 0.94 and MAE < 5, showing that interpretable models can offer both high accuracy and operational simplicity. The study emphasizes practical deployment of transparent models in environmental monitoring systems.
