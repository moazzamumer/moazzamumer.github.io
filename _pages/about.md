I am a BS Data Science graduate from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences with hands-on experience across research, industry, and global competitions. I enjoy building impactful AI systems and collaborating on projects that connect theory with real-world applications.

As a Research Assistant at FAST NUCES under [Dr. Asma Ahmad](https://lhr.nu.edu.pk/fsc/facultyProfile/4335), I work on forecasting, federated learning, and vision-language applications. My research includes developing methods for multivariate time series modeling in air quality prediction, designing federated pipelines for multi-sensor human activity recognition, and advancing domain-aware vision-language models to improve culturally relevant image captioning. Together, these projects aim to build trustworthy, multimodal AI systems with real-world impact.

### <span style="color: salmon;">I am actively seeking graduate research opportunities (MS/PhD) in areas related to AI, ML, and data science and also open to collaborative opportunities in research and applied AI.</span>
