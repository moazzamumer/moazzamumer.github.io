I am a BS Data Science graduate from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences with hands-on experience across research, industry, and global competitions. I enjoy building impactful AI systems and collaborating on projects that connect theory with real-world applications.

As a research assistant at FAST NUCES supervised by [Dr. Asma Ahmad](https://lhr.nu.edu.pk/fsc/facultyProfile/4335), I am engaged in research that explores forecasting, federated learning, and vision-language applications. My work includes developing methods for multivariate time series modeling and air quality prediction, where I experiment with advanced forecasting techniques and distributed frameworks.
In parallel, I design federated learning pipelines for multi-sensor human activity recognition, enabling robust models to train across heterogeneous datasets while preserving privacy. I am also advancing domain-aware vision-language models, improving image captioning systems with cultural and contextual relevance. Collectively, these projects aim to build trustworthy, multimodal AI systems that connect research with real-world impact.

### <span style="color: salmon;">I am actively seeking graduate research opportunities (MS/PhD) in areas related to AI, ML, and data science and also open to collaborative opportunities in research and applied AI.</span>

## Research Interests
